# Get started

## Installation

Xiwa Design System components are written in React. They are documented in Storybook.

### Add Xiwa Design System to your project

Run `npm install @tln/xiwa-react` or `yarn add @tln/xiwa-react`.

_**Please note:** this guide is currently a proof of concept. The package above isn't available yet. If you still want to use the Xiwa Design System for React already in your project, contact a The Learning Network (IT) operative._

### Use the components

Import the components you want to use in your project:

```jsx
import { XiwaButton } from '@tln/xiwa-react';
```

Then, you can use them like so:

```jsx
const Example = () => (
  <div>
    <XiwaButton variant="primary">
      Click Me!
    </XiwaButton>
  </div>
);
```

This will render the following:
<Canvas>
<div>
  <XiwaButton variant="primary">Click Me!</XiwaButton>
</div>
</Canvas>

### Use the styles

More information on this topic will follow, soon.
