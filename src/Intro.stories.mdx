# Xiwa Design System

## Get started

The Xiwa Design System (XDS) is a reusable React component library that helps <a href="https://www.thelearningnetwork.nl/" target="_blank">The Learing Network</a> contributors build UIs faster. Its goal is to make building durable, accessible UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Installation

XDS components are written in React. They are documented in Storybook.

This documentation also contains basic information about how to use the SCSS (according to BEM guidelines) for if you want to write HTML.

It also contains information on variables used such as colors.

### Add XDS to your project

`npm install xxx`

### Use the components

Import the components you want to use in your project:

```jsx
import { XiwaButton } from 'xxx';
```

Then, you can use them like so:

```jsx
const Example = () => (
  <div>
    <XiwaButton variant="primary">
      Click Me!
    </XiwaButton>
  </div>
);
```
